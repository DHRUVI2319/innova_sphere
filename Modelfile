this ihs the layout of different water treatment plants and their child nodes in the city of Indore,
i will give you the amount of water flowing in each, you have to predict if there is a water shortage
in any of the child nodes or any leakage in the pipeline. in consise only give me the leakage and shortage in under 200 words
