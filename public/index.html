<!-- 
Water supply management system for the municipal corporation.
Background: Indore, like many cities, relies heavily on river water for its supply, with the
Narmada River being the primary source.
The key issue in Indore's water management system is the absence of a
mechanism to measure and track the amount of water distributed to each household. Although
the intake from the Narmada River is monitored, the distribution across different wards and
areas within the city is not. This lack of measurement and tracking results in several challenges:
1. Inability to identify and address water wastage or leakages.
2. Difficulties in ensuring equitable distribution of water.
3. Lack of data to support decision-making for maintenance and upgrades of the water supply -->
